# Image Bundling Fix

## Issue Fixed ✅

**Problem:** 
- `assets/images/friends.png` was a text placeholder file, not a real PNG image
- This caused Metro bundler to fail with "unsupported file type: undefined" error
- The error occurred because the bundler tried to process a text file as an image

**Solution:**
1. ✅ Deleted the corrupted `assets/images/friends.png` placeholder file
2. ✅ Updated `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` to use `require('../../img/Excited.png')` instead
3. ✅ Used existing proper image from the `img` directory

## Files Changed:
- ❌ Deleted: `assets/images/friends.png` (text placeholder)
- ✅ Updated: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (changed image reference)

## Test Steps:
1. Start the development server: `npm start` or `expo start`
2. The bundling should now complete without errors
3. Check that the "Find Friends" action card displays properly with the Excited.png image
4. Verify no more "unsupported file type" errors in terminal

## Available Images:
The following images are confirmed working in the `img/` directory:
- ✅ happy.png
- ✅ Excited.png  
- ✅ movie.png
- ✅ Hungry.png
- ✅ Lonely.png
- ✅ Moody.png
- ✅ Romantic.png
- ✅ sad.png
- ✅ Tired.png

All these are proper binary image files that Metro can process correctly.
